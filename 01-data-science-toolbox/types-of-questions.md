# Types of Questions

## Descriptive analysis

Describes a set of data

* First data analysis performed
* Usually used for census data
* This doesn't involve interpretation of the results

## Exploratory analysis

Find relationships that are not known

* E.g. a study finds that certain parts of the brain will respond to different stimuli. No causation can be deduced but this can be used for further investigation

## Inferential analysis

Use a small sample to say something about a larger population e.g. how air pollution affects life expectancy across a number of counties - this can then be extrapolated to the rest of the country

## Predictive analysis

Use data on one object to predict values for another object e.g. using polling data to determine who will win an election

## Causal analysis

What happens to one variable when another variable changes

* Involves randomised studies
* "Gold standard" for data analysis

## Mechanistic analysis

Understand the exact changes in variables that lead to changes in other variables

* Usually used in physical sciences/engineering
