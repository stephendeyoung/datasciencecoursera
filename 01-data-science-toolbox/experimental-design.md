# Experimental design

Good experiments:

* Can be replicated
* Measure variability
* Generalise to our problem
* Are transparent
* Randomise where it's not possible to fix a variable

Beware data dredging (asking the data similar types of questions repeatedly e.g. jelly beans cause X, green jelly beans cause X, red jelly beans cause X)
